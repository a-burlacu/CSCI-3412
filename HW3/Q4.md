# Q4:
### a) List 3 recursion types w.r.t. the way of diminishing input size for each recursion to reach the termination of recursions. Also provide a short high-level description of each type and specific algorithms that fall into each type.


**1. Constant Fraction Type:**

Where the subproblem is a constant fraction of the original problem size (e.g. 1/2, 
1/3) and remains this way each recursive iteration of the algorithm

Examples include:
- Merge Sort
- Binary Search
- Matrix Multiplications

**2. Variable(Random) Fraction Type:**

The subproblem size is dependent upon what pivot is chosen and where the partition 
occurs based on the values in an array of elements. Unlike constant fraction type, 
these recursions can be any fraction each iteration.

Examples include:

- Quick Sort
- Kth Element Search

**3. Constant Linear Reduction Type:**

Each recursive iteration will reduce the original problem into subproblems of a 
specified whole number, such as (n-1) and (n-2). These remain constant each iteration,
and therefore the function will only be reduced by this size each time.

Examples include: 

- Factorial
- Fibonacci
