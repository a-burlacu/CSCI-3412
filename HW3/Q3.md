# Q3:
### a) How should we choose k in practice? (Hint:  can you do any better than actual simulation, trial-and-errors?)

We should choose k values that are large enough in practice, since most algorithms 
"make it or break it" after input size is sufficiently large.

### b) Find and fully understand the algorithms of quicksort and bubble sort.  Say "Yes" if you do.

Yes

### c) Write separate test programs of both algorithms (bubble sort and quicksort) with atest data set of your choice and demonstrate they work. (perhaps with the size of 20 unsorted integers)

Here are the time results:

BubbleSort efficiency for 20 integers  {       
start: 0.578210   
end: 0.578262   
time efficiency: 0.000267}         
Unsorted array: [-21, -34, 22, -32, -35, 3, 30, 7, -41, 22, 25, -50, 2, 47, -35, 13, 11, 1, 23, 36]           
Sorted array: [-50, -41, -35, -35, -34, -32, -21, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 22, 22, 23, 25, 30, 36, 47]

QuickSort efficiency for 20 integers  {       
start: 0.591565   
end: 0.591628   
time efficiency: 0.000584}         
Unsorted array: [-44, 24, -40, 50, 24, 8, 47, -34, 8, -26, -17, 9, -37, -36, -12, 14, 10, 24, 1, -42]           
Sorted array: [-44, -42, -40, -37, -36, -34, -26, -17, -12, 1, 8, 8, 9, 10, 14, 24, 24, 24, 47, 50]
